r"""\
Duct is a library for running child processes. Duct makes it easy to build
pipelines and redirect IO like a shell. At the same time, Duct helps you write
correct, portable code: whitespace is never significant, errors from child
processes get reported by default, and a variety of `gotchas, bugs, and
platform inconsistencies
<https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.py/blob/master/gotchas.md>`_ are handled
for you the Right Wayâ„¢.

- `GitHub repo <https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.rs>`_
- `PyPI package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/duct>`_
- `the same library, in Rust <https://github.com/oconnor663/duct.rs>`_

Examples
--------

Run a command without capturing any output. Here "hi" is printed directly to
the terminal:

>>> from duct import cmd
>>> cmd("echo", "hi").run() # doctest: +SKIP
hi
Output(status=0, stdout=None, stderr=None)

Capture the standard output of a command. Here "hi" is returned as a string:

>>> cmd("echo", "hi").read()
'hi'

Capture the standard output of a pipeline:

>>> cmd("echo", "hi").pipe(cmd("sed", "s/i/o/")).read()
'ho'

Merge standard error into standard output and read both incrementally:

>>> big_cmd = cmd("bash", "-c", "echo out && echo err 1>&2")
>>> reader = big_cmd.stderr_to_stdout().reader()
>>> with reader:
...     reader.readlines()
[b'out\n', b'err\n']

Children that exit with a non-zero status raise an exception by default:

>>> cmd("false").run()
Traceback (most recent call last):
...
duct.StatusError: Expression cmd('false') returned non-zero exit status: Output(status=1, stdout=None, stderr=None)
>>> cmd("false").unchecked().run()
Output(status=1, stdout=None, stderr=None)

# There's a tricky interaction between exe paths and `dir`. Exe paths can be
# relative, and so we have to ask: Is an exe path interpreted relative to the
# parent's cwd, or the child's? The answer is that it's platform dependent! >.<
# (Windows uses the parent's cwd, but because of the fork-chdir-exec pattern,
# Unix usually uses the child's.)
#
# We want to use the parent's cwd consistently, because that saves the caller
# from having to worry about whether `dir` will have side effects, and because
# it's easy for the caller to use path.join if they want to. That means that
# when `dir` is in use, we need to detect exe names that are relative paths,
# and absolutify them. We want to do that as little as possible though, both
# because canonicalization can fail, and because we prefer to let the caller
# control the child's argv[0].
#
# We never want to absolutify a name like "emacs", because that's probably a
# program in the PATH rather than a local file. So we look for slashes in the
# name to determine what's a filepath and what isn't. Note that anything given
# as a Path will always have a slash by the time we get here, because
# stringify_with_dot_if_path prepends a ./ to them when they're relative. This
# leaves the case where Windows users might pass a local file like "foo.bat" as
# a string, which we can't distinguish from a global program name. However,
# because the Windows has the preferred "relative to parent's cwd" behavior
# already, this case actually works without our help. (The thing Windows users
# have to watch out for instead is local files shadowing global program names,

# inheritable file descriptors, which leak to all child processes and prevent
# reads from reaching EOF. The workaround for this is to set close_fds=True on
# POSIX, which was not the default in those versions. See PEP 0446 for many
# details.
#
# TODO: Revisit this workaround when we drop Python 2 support.
#
# The second issue arises on Windows, where we're not allowed to set
# close_fds=True while also setting stdin/stdout/stderr. Descriptors from
# os.pipe() on Windows have never been inheritable, so it would seem that we're
# safe. However, the Windows implementation of subprocess.Popen() creates
# temporary inheritable copies of its descriptors, and these can leak. The
# workaround for this is to protect Popen() with a global lock. See
# https://bugs.python.org/issue25565.

# subprocess.Popen. That type works around another race condition to do with

# The wait() and kill() methods on the standard library Popen class have a race
# condition on Unix. Normally kill() checks to see whether a process has
# already been awaited before sending a signal, so that if the PID has been
# reused by an unrelated process in the meantime it won't accidentally signal
# that unrelated process. However, if kill() and wait() are called from
# different threads, it's possible for wait() to free the PID *after* kill()
# has seen that the child is still running. If the kill() thread pauses at
# exactly that moment, long enough for the OS to reuse the PID, kill() could
# kill the wrong process. This is unlikely under ordinary circumstances, but
# more likely if the system is under heavy load and the PID space is almost
# exhausted.
#
# The workaround for this race condition on Unix is to use:
#
#     os.waitid(os.P_PID, child_pid, os.WEXITED | os.WNOWAIT)
#
# That call waits on the child to exit, but *doesn't* free its PID for reuse.
# Then we set an internal flag that's synchronized with kill(), before finally
# calling wait() to reap the child.
#
# Note that Windows doesn't have this problem, because child handles (unlike
# raw PIDs) have to be explicitly closed.
